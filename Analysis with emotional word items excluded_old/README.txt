This repository contains the analysis of each experiment where items that contain emotional words have been excluded. For the Anger Fear Experiment (Experiment 1) these were items 18,22,27,and 29. For the Happy Sad Experiment (Experiment 2) these were items 1,8,10,15,18,19,22,28,29,and 30. Even with these items excluded, the interactions (and associated pairwise comparisons) for both experiments are statistically highly robust.
